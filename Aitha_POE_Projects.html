                        In this project, we were told to build a car that was powered by alternative energy sources (solar panels and hydrogen cells). This project required us to use the skills that we had just recently learned about power, voltage, current, and resistance to make an optimal power configuration using alternative power resources. My personal responsibilities in this project were to build the chassis of the car and help with wiring the motor and the power sources on a breadboard. I learned a lot from this project, especially about how hydrogen cells work (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, then recombining it to produce energy). Some skills I utilized in this project were communication skills, math skills (using Ohm's Law and P=IV), and technology skills (creating a simulation of the car in NetLogo). We found that the solar cell was much more efficient and useful than the hydrogen cells. First, we had to build a car that could be functional so that we could travel quickly over the span of a one meter distance. We conducted multiple tests to find the optimal configuration, which turned out to be one hydrogen cell and one solar cell wired in parallel. We had to modify our design a couple times because we found that we didn't have enough torque to overcome the frictional force of the table and the resistance force coming from the weight of the car itself. So, we decided to change our gear ratio from 7:1 (which provided too much speed and not enough torque) to 5:3, which provided a good balance of speed and torque.

                        In this project, I was asked to construct an aerodynamically sound rocket using only paper and certain types of tape (which included packing tape, duct tape, scotch tape, etc.). This project required me to use skills that I had learned about aerodynamic capabilities of planes, and the various forces that act upon a body in the air, such as drag, thrust, lift, and gravity. My personal responsibilities in this project were to build the rocket and record data during the test launches. Some skills I utilized in this project were math skills, physics skills, free body diagrams, force vector diagrams, and various equations to calculate the distance and/or velocity of the rocket at a single point. The constraints and further information for this project can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qkUAQEUPy9462oes7L8aWdvFH96zBWYwSZvf-qZUBE8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. For this project, I had 2 opportunities to launch two separate rockets that I designed. For my first launch, I constructed a rocket out of thin construction paper and duct tape. I used 3 triangular fins that were roughly 1/4 of the height of the body of the rocket, and I placed them at the bottom of the rocket. My first rocket traveled 84 yards in 4.76 seconds. I launched both of my rockets at 45 degrees and 60 psi. After a couple days of designing my second rocket, I launched it but unfortunately it only traveled 18 yards in 1.96 seconds. This was due to the fact that I used packing tape instead of duct tape to secure the pressure cap and nose to the body, so they both detached from the body of the rocket during the launch sequence. This caused the air resistance to overcome the thrust, which provided an opportunity for gravity to pull the rocket down to the ground. If you're interested in building your own rocket or seeing the rest of our data and design process, take a look at our documentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTbbBhzAOMiSUsefd2LaWfaPRKdLCBd9M9kFBeF84bM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
