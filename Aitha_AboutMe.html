                Hi, my name is Aarush Aitha and I go to Dublin High School. I desire to be an astronomer (specifically an astrophysicist) with a strong computer science background. When I was very young, my family and I once went to the Exploratorium. I rushed around the three floors, interacting with models around me, reading about outer space, and listening to people much older than me give speeches about different parts of the universe. As a result, I ended up getting lost and my parents could not find me where ever they looked. Luckily, I was safe, and not scared at all. I had gone to the planetarium to watch a presentation on the huge, seemingly infinite screen. Ever since that experience, I realized that studying astronomy and learning more about the world around me was one of my greatest passions. On that note, computer science (mainly coding) is my other great passion. I got into coding when I joined the TriValley CoderDojo club, which is a safe and loosely-controlled coding environment that my dad and I go to on Wednesdays. There are mentors and volunteers and just regular members to help you at all times, and at the end of the day everyone gets a chance to present the product that they have created within the two hours that they were given. CoderDojo has taught me so many things other than coding skills, such as leadership, teaching skills, communication skills, presentation skills, and a broader understanding of technology. I realized that when I was coding and asking for help from my peers and helping others when they needed it, I was truly happy and that was when I realized that I loved to program.

                In terms of computer science, I already possess a lot of the skills that are needed to become a computer scientist as a result of my participation in CoderDojo. When I was mentoring kindergarteners, at first I got very frustrated when they wouldn't understand it immediately, and then I just gave them the answer which didn't help them at all. Throughout the years, I have learned to be more patient with people when I am teaching them because it won't help anyone if I get impatient. I have been attending CoderDojo for roughly 3 years as of my freshman year, so a lot of the other members, parents, and volunteers depend on me to help out around the club, whether it be to fix something with the video/audio, or just introduce a parent to the CoderDojo club. CoderDojo has also taught me that first impressions are important, so once you have made your first impression, you can show who you truly are through your actions. I don't have many achievements in this line of work, however I have observed a couple of Hackathons and I participated in one before.

                In terms of astronomy, the skill that has allowed me to accelerate to the level of proficiency that I currently possess is curiosity. I am naturally talented in math and science already, and I possess a continually expanding vocabulary as well. Again, I don't have many achievements from high school as of now, however I do have quite a lot of medals and trophies for math and science competitions within the bay area. I have participated in Math Counts, American Math Contest (AMC), Math League, and Math Kangaroo in my previous years, and I plan to keep participating and practicing in these competitions.             <br/>

            <p id="concludepar">
                In conclusion, I am someone who loves to study astronomy and program. I am a well rounded person because I also am very competitive and I play lots of sports and I enjoy them. Hopefully, this short introduction has given you a small insight into who I truly am. Thank you for your time, and please read and enjoy the other features of my portfolio!
