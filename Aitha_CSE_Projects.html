                        Scratch, a website created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a simple coding environment wih drag and drop elements that are easy to work with for people who are new to computer programming. The Scratch Project was the first partner-oriented task that we were given in CSE (Computer Science/Software Engineering). We were told to make a fully functioning game, given some basic <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" target="_blank">criteria</a>. We also made a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> account, created a project, and shared it between me and Zachary so that we both had access to it. Our game was called "A Battle Against Grey". One important requirement for the Scratch Project, and most other projects, was to create an Engineering Notebook. This notebook included daily documentation of our progress throughout the given timeframe. It also contains our original ideas, a flowchart created with <a href="https://www.draw.io/" target="_blank">draw.io</a>, instructions to our game, and comments. The notebook that we edited and worked on is linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZTqT0R77vchfeOw84Px1VmSYcGYXB_XuEyWWjiKLjE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. For this project, we had multiple drafts for our game. The first draft is linked <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172692606/" target="_blank">here</a>, while the second and final draft is linked <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173775774/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please feel free to comment, like, remix, and play our game in Scratch!

                        In this project, we were asked to manipulate an image based on a chosen client's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g919kguNczub1LxhojTfSCugJ-o8HiE33m9lY2A0l80/edit" target = "_blank">requirements</a>. We used the <a href="http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm" target = "_blank">PIL Imaging Library</a> to add multiple manipulations. Our code worked on an entire folder of images that was provided by the user, showing that our manipulations were not unique to specific types of images. We chose McDonald's as our client, so two out of our three manipulations were centered around them. Our first manipulation blended the McDonalds logo and the current image from the folder, and the user was able to have interaction with the code by specifying a ratio between the opacity of the logo and the given image. Our second manipulation shrunk the McDonalds logo to 25x25, and then it pasted the mini image over and over around the given image to create a border made out of mini-logos. Our last manipulation was not really related to McDonalds, so it just inverted all the colors of the image. Throughout this project, we were asked to keep a documentation of all our work, which is linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqOa3IfVJniTR17SLgbvmttbEsbNjXJzc1CgfAWUhg4/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a>. We coded our manipulations in an online cloud IDE called Cloud 9, and the link to our workspace can be found <a href="https://ide.c9.io/aarush3002/cse4-aitha-a" target = "_blank">here</a>. Please feel free to use our manipulations in any way you want! You can change the logo that we used as well.
