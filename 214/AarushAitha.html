        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Aarush Aitha and I am a freshman who goes to Dublin High. I love to code websites using HTML, CSS, and Repsonsive Bootstrap Design. This is my chance to show the knowledge that I have learned throughout this course (CSE Period 4). I hope you enjoy my website!</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy solving puzzles (especially Rubik's Cubes) and participating in academic and athletic competitions (where I excel). One of my greatest passions is reading because I believe that reading allows you to absorb knowledge quicker than any other source. I love learning new things all the time, so reading is the perfect hobby for me. Whenever I have the time, I also like to play video games such as League of Legends. Finally, I enjoy spending time with my family and other relatives.</p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
