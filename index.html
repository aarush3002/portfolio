                My name is Aarush Aitha, and my goal is to become a cyber defense expert.  I would like to work at Google, doing a job to protect the privacy of users at all times. I am currently a tenth grader at Dublin High School, taking Principles of Engineering, AP Statistics, and AP Chemistry. I am also competing in a cybersecurity competition (AFA CyberPatriot) and am currently the captain of a 6 member team. Additionally, I am a programmer for a VEX Robotics Team (5327X), and we have already qualified to the state round. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a cyber defense expert, I will continue to excel at these things, as well as take the CyberSecurity and Cisco Networking classes, and continue to participate in the AFA CyberPatriot competition.  I also plan on attending MIT or Carnegie Mellon college, and majoring in computer science/cyber security, in order to continue pursuing my goal.

            <p id="explanation">
                As I mentioned previously, my goal is to become a cyber defense expert with a strong computer science background. I've always known that I would become a programmer/software engineer, but my dream to become a cyber defense expert was ignited when I was 10 years old. My brother was hacked by a phishing attack and lost all the data on his laptop. This incident inspired me to be more careful with my actions on computers, and it also inspired me to become a defense expert so that no one close to me would ever have to have such a frightening experience again. Throughout middle school, I studied various programming languages to prepare me for writing scripts and programs to protect the important data of my friends and family. At the beginning of high school, I became eligible for the AFA CyberPatriot competition. I had already been attending the high school club's meets during middle school, so as a freshman I was ready to captain my own team of 6 members. I have learned a lot of useful practices from CyberPatriots that I use in my everyday life, such as always keeping the Firewall on, never clicking suspicious links in emails, auditing programs and tasks, penetration testing against a servers and websites, and many other vital security practices. I have a lot of passion for this area of interest because I've always been interested to know how to prevent myself from being hacked by other people, and if I learn these skills, then I can also make a change in the world by protecting the data of everyone in the world.

            <p id="strengths">
                As a dedicated, diligent, and hardworking high school student, I often find that focusing in school and achieving the grades that I desire is simple, meaning that I'm confident in my abilities to succeed in college and beyond. I have been told before that I have a lot of perseverance, especially when I am told that I can't do something. This led me to learn subjects that were years above my grade level during middle school and high school. This was shown especially in 8th grade, when I started taking math at the high school because there were no more math courses that the middle school could provide for me. I was revered by classmates that were older than me, and I excelled in a class that was extremely above my grade level. I am also resourceful, because I am mostly a self-taught programmer and learned most of what I know now from online courses and reading articles on languages that I was interested in learning. Programming has always been like solving a math problem for me, and I live for the satisfaction that I receive when I fully debug a program that I had been working on for the past couple of months.

            <p id="accomplishments">
                As I entered high school, my interest for computer science and software engineering was at its peak, and I was introduced and invited to the Cyber Security club. I formed a team, and my team and I placed in the top 10 percent of the nation. Over the summer between ninth and tenth grade, I completed a college level computer science course which was at an accelerated pace, Introduction to Structured C++. It was an extremely rigorous class, but I was able to persevere through all the challenges it presented and I achieved the grade that I desired. Currently, I am on a competitive robotics team (5327X) and I am the programmer for my team. The season hasn't ended yet, but we have already qualified for the state rounds and are currently working on an autonomous program for the Skills Challenge. In middle school, I won the school spelling bee in mid January of 2017 (as an 8th grader), and after winning the Junior High Dublin School District competition, I moved on to the Alameda County Junior High Spelling bee in March of 2017, in which I placed first. I finally placed seventh in the California Junior High state spelling bee later on in May 2017, which was one of my greatest achievements of junior high.

                While I am only a sophomore in high school, I have learned that I am a hardworking, persevering, resourceful, and diligent student who always takes the initiative whenever I can. I have a strong passion for cyber security and cyber defense, and I desire to be an expert in this field with a fully developed computer science and software engineering background. I have exeperience in programming with Java, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also skilled with using the terminal in Linux systems, since the CyberPatriot competitions require an in depth knowledge of this operating system. Through my past experiences, I have learned that knowledge is the one way to succeed in life, and I would do anything to gain more of it.
